1. `cd "insert the directory"`: This line sets the working directory to the specified directory, allowing Stata to access files from that location.

2. `use training_data, clear`: This line loads the dataset named "training_data" into Stata, clearing any existing data in memory.

3. `ta lga`: This command generates a frequency table of the variable "lga" (Local Government Area) in the dataset, showing the count of observations in each LGA.

4. `keep if agey >= 60`: This line keeps only the observations where the variable "agey" (Age in Complete Years) is greater than or equal to 60, effectively filtering out individuals below the age of 60.

5. `ta lga`: Another frequency table of the variable "lga" is generated after the age filter.

6. `keep if disability == 1`: This line keeps only the observations where the variable "disability" is equal to 1, indicating that the individual has a disability.

7. `ta lga`: Another frequency table of the variable "lga" is generated after the disability filter.

8. `keep if chronicallyill ==1`: This line keeps only the observations where the variable "chronicallyill" is equal to 1, indicating that the individual is chronically ill.

9. `keep if urbanrural == 1`: This line keeps only the observations where the variable "urbanrural" is equal to 1, indicating that the individual is an urban dweller.

10. `ta lga`: Another frequency table of the variable "lga" is generated after the urban dweller filter.

11. `contract lga`: This command aggregates the data by the "lga" variable, collapsing it to unique LGAs and calculating the sum of observations in each LGA.

12. `rename _freq beneficiaries`: The variable "_freq" is renamed to "beneficiaries" for clarity.

13. `export excel mined_lga_less80 if beneficiaries<85, sheetreplace firstrow(variable)`: This line exports the data to an Excel file named "mined_lga_less80" for LGAs with less than 85 beneficiaries.

14. `preserve`: This command saves a copy of the current dataset in memory.

15. `restore`: This command restores the dataset to its original state before the "preserve" command was used.

16. `export excel mined_lga, sheetreplace firstrow(variable)`: This line exports the original data to an Excel file named "mined_lga."

17. `export excel mined_lga_above80 if beneficiaries>85, sheetreplace firstrow(variable)`: This line exports the data to an Excel file named "mined_lga_above80" for LGAs with more than 85 beneficiaries
